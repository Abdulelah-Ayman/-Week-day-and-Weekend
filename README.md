## 🧠 Program Overview
1. The program uses a `Scanner` to take an integer input from the user, representing a day of the week.  
2. It uses a `switch` statement to determine the type of day:
   - `1–5` → Weekday  
   - `6–7` → Weekend  
3. The result is printed to the console.

📝 Notes

Input must be an integer between 1 and 7.

The program does not handle invalid input values (e.g., numbers greater than 7 or negative numbers).

You can easily modify or extend the code to display actual day names (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
